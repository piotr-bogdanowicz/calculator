# Wedding Calculator

This is an implementation of the requested recruitment task.

I introduced enums for service types and actions, yet I was unsure if it was a good approach to edit unit tests at all.
I treated it like external contract that I should not change (except for one non-functional typo fix in test descriptions).
Thus you can see types allowing for pure string inputs, while enums are done more for my coding convenience.
